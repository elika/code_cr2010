Simple Data Visualization using Javascript

A talk for the "Conferencia Rails, 2010" (Madrid)

Creating useful and usable visual representation of a set of data is in general a difficult
task involving knowledge of math, programming and some statistics and design.
Nevertheless, on the web there are many situations where we only need a simple
chart to represent our data. When this is the case we can use any of the plenty
of JavaScript libraries available out there for rendering numerical data into
interactive visualization. 

This talk is about the use of two of these libraries, Raphaël (http://raphaeljs.com/) and
ProtoVis (http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/) to convert a table with numbers into interactive chart. Both libraries use a SVG object to represent the data but differ in
the way this object is created. 

Here you can find the talk examples's source code and the PDF file with the presentation.
